# tkinter_gui_weather
I made this small app by following Keith Galli's tutorial on youtube (https://youtu.be/D8-snVfekto)
I used the following libraries:

- tkinter
- PIL (pillow)
- requests

I had a lot of fun creating a graphical app on python, it was my first time!
If you want to use my script, please remember to insert your api key for openweathermap.org
